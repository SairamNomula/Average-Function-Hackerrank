# Python: Average Function-Hackerrank

Question: 
Implement a function that:
1.Is named avg
2.Takes a variable number of integer arguments; it is guaranteed that at least one argument will be passed
3.Returns the average value of the passed arguments as a float
The implementation will be tested by a provided code stub on several input files. Each input file contains one line with space-separated arguments for the function. The function will be called with those arguments, and the returned result will be printed to the output with exactly 2 decimal places.
